							<p><h1>Executive Summary</h1></p>
							<p>I have heard the sharing shared by Mr. Shadrul and Mr. Danial about their experience working at AirAsia. From the sharing from Mr. Shardul, the manager, Software Engineering AirAsia, I was interested in the internship opportunities given to prospective software engineering graduates from UTM which gives them the opportunity to gain experience at AirAsia. The job opportunities given in the field of software engineering are frontend developer, backend developer, DevOps/SRE, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Tester and Business Analyst. The typical day-to-day activities of a software engineer in AirAsia, including daily stand-ups, code reviews, and the importance of well-defined processes. Working culture in AirAsia is very different from the working culture in other places, they practice "No Sir culture" where they do not call Sir or Madam even though they have a high rank, they only call by name because AirAsia considers "all employees are stars". so if no sir culture i think we will start comfort with everyone and easy to share any idea and feedback each other. Through the sharing from Mr. Danial, the Head of Software Engineering AirAsia also attracted my attention. Mr. Danial shared that he has working experience in software engineering for 20 years and said that working at AirAsia is the best experience because working in the department can work from home where when WFH we can arrange our time without having to be tied to working hours. En Danial shared that when WFH we can be more flexible in our time and no morning commute, but WFH also give bad impact it is because when WFH it is hard to connect with your coworkers, it is less productive and less accountability. Therefore, Mr. Danial shared WFH tips such as first, designated physical workspace. Second, set up a routine, your morning ritual. Third is communication, use all the channels of communication and always pick up the phone and call. Forth is to avoid meeting fatigue, block your calendar, i.e. Lunch. Fifth is reserved time for social interaction with your coworkers and lastly is switch off at the end of the day</p>

							<p><b>Point 1</b>: Strong in Fundamental AirAsia is the big company, and the recruitment process will be more challenging. So to join AirAsia.com, I need to be strong in fundamentals. It is because based on the carrier talk, Mr. Shahrul informs the typical day-to-day activities of a software engineer in AirAsia, including daily stand-ups, code reviews, and the importance of well-defined processes.</p>
							<p><b>Point 2</b>: Communication is the key. Working at AirAsia, some software engineers will work from home. When WFH, we will get many obstacles that will be faced, especially in communication. Some coworkers do not understand what their coworker delivers, and to make it understandable is not easy. Mr. Danial emphasizes communication with the team to use any tool of communication to help coworkers understand what to deliver during WFH. Nowadays, we have many applications that we can use for communication, such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Microsoft Team, Webex, Discord, etc. From my reflection, communication is very important to make it task in succefully. Keep in contact with each other to make sure all the content is delivered successfully and the task can be submitted on time.</p>

							<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
							<p>This repository for tutorial how to setup MASM and Irvine Library in Visual Studio. This assembly languange using X64 Processor Architecture and using Visual Studio 2019. Assembly languange is a great tool for learning how a computer works, and it requires you to have a working knowledge of computer hardware. The concept in this section will help to undertand the assembly language code that be written. For this situation to use higher-level languages like C++ in Visual Studio, need to setup MASM and Irvine Library in Visual Studio before create the program</p>

							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>For the reflection, it is very helpful to me a lot how to communicate with higher-level languages like C++ in Visual Studio 2019. It also helps me to understand the assembly language code that will be written. Now i have basic knowledge in programming C++; in future, i want to develop more understanding for other programming such as Python, HTML, Java, etc</p>

							<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
							<p>Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall, a professional with a strong background in system development, highlighted the importance of technical and management skills in the tech industry. He highlighted the need for adaptability and expertise in emerging fields like AI and blockchain.
								Mr. Nik Habibullah bin Muhammad Nizam, an entrepreneur with 19 years of experience, emphasized the importance of being brave to challenge oneself and continuously learning. He started as a student and later worked as a special officer at the Ministry of the Government Malaysia (KPT) under Datoâ€™ Adnan Barber. He eventually established Micro Semiconductor Sdn. Bhd, which was later sold to a friend due to company issues and commitment.

He shared his tips for becoming an entrepreneur, including knowing one's strengths and career goals, building a CV and pro-folio, and handling interviews.

							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>The reflection from the talk is understand computer science apart from working is government 
								and private we can be as entrepreneur. Computer Science is in very high demand in the market 
								right now. After attend this industry talk, in four years I want to develop system and machine 
								start from my problems during working. My company 5DX machine use 2D image that cannot 
								to capture image reject in accuracy. So want to develop system to use system that can capture 
								image in clearly and get the percentage barrier fill for solder cavity.</p>

							<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
							<p>The repository for PC Assemble Lab. During class TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (SECP 1513) that we conduct with Dr. Haza, we have done a lab to assemble computer hardware, and I am one of the students who are involved in the success of this lab. This lab aim to show how to assemble computer hardware based on PC Assemble Workshop that i joined in the class</p>
							<h1>Reflection</h1>
							<p>This is my first experience with setting up computer hardware. I am always curious what component hardware is in a computer and what their function is. After this lab I know how to build computer hardware and what tooling to use. In the lab, many feedback and discussions that students gave, and Dr. Haza gave a good response during this class. In future, if I have opportunity again to assemble PC, I want to assemble PC individually so I can better understand</p>
